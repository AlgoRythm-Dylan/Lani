<h1>Icons</h1>
<p>
    Lani uses icons to give visual cues to the
    user where appropriate. By default, Lani uses
    FontAwesome (version 6), but this is not
    a required dependency (though, at least some
    icon system is expected)
</p>
<p>
    Lani internally uses the
    <code>&lt;lani-icon&gt;</code>
    web component to make the concept of an icon
    more abstract so that some kind of icon service
    (in this case, the 
    <code>Lani.IconResolver</code>) can take this
    element on the DOM and transform it into a
    valid icon
</p>
<p>
    The <code>&lt;lani-icon&gt;</code> element
    expects a single attribute:
    <code>icon</code>. This attribute will be used
    to resolve the icon using the current icon resolver
</p>
<p>
    You do not need to use the
    <code>&lt;lani-icon&gt;</code> element when you
    wish to use icons on your site. This element
    was largely intended to be used so that Lani
    didn't need to be tightly coupled to any one icon
    library. <b>However</b>, as it provides a layer
    of abstraction, it could be a great tool for
    dependency management. If you want to upgrade your
    icons to new versions with breaking changes, change
    your icon provider, or make any other change to
    all icons on your site, you only need to write
    a new icon resolver - potentially making the work
    <i>incredibly</i> easy, compared to completely
    replacing each icon on your entire site.
